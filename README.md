# Home_Sales

In this challenge, Spark was used to make temporary views, partition data, cache and uncache a temporary table, verify that the table was uncached, and determine run times for queries.

In particular, knowledge of SparkSQL was applied to determine key metrics about home sales data. The key metrics answered the following questions:

What is the average price for a four-bedroom house sold for each year?

What is the average price of a home for each year the home was built, that has three bedrooms and three bathrooms?

What is the average price of a home for each year the home was built, that has three bedrooms, three bathrooms, two floors, and is greater than or equal to 2,000 square feet?

What is the average price of a home per "view" rating having an average home price greater than or equal to $350,000?
